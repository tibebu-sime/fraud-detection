# Background on credit card fraud-detection

Traditionally businesses relied on rules alone to block fraudulent payments. Despite the fact that rules still remain to be an important part of the anti-fraud toolkit, using them alone can cause a lot of problems nowadays because of the growing complexity of the dynamics of the real-world payment card transactions data. In addition, since rule-based systems over-generalize specific constraints across varying transactions, they tend to result in a high number of false positives -- meaning that a lot of genuine customers will incorrectly be flagged as fraud. 

So, the aim of this project is to build a model that predicts/classifies whether a transaction is fraudulent or not. The data analysis is based on a historical dataset which contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders.
